# gamescope patches carried by the app

Carried over from DroidDeck (Droid-Deck/DroidDeck, tools/gamescope), which runs the same hosted
runtime. Built by `.github/workflows/gamescope.yml` on top of the exact gamescope the Linux runtime
ships (3.16.29, Arch Linux ARM's package, same build options), and staged from the apk over
`/usr/local/bin/gamescope` at each session start - the hosted runtime image is never touched.
The binary's shared-library needs are checked against `runtime-sonames.txt`, the runtime's own
library list, before anything is published.

- `0002-steamcompmgr-fallback-appid-focus.patch` - Armada (armada-os/armada), verbatim.
- `0009-fix-arm64-steam-night-mode.patch` - Armada, verbatim: the ARM64 client packs the
  night-mode property differently; the slider did nothing.
- `0019-steamcompmgr-arm64-virtual-white.patch` - Armada, verbatim: the colour-temperature
  slider's (x, y) arrives as one 64-bit element from the ARM64 client; y is recovered from x.
- `0020-color-p3-red-is-wide-gamut.patch` - Armada, verbatim.
- `0100-realtime-queue-and-gamepad-cursor.patch` - DroidDeck, two of Armada's ported by hand onto
  3.16.29: realtime-priority Vulkan queues on request (`GAMESCOPE_FORCE_VULKAN_REALTIME=1`)
  without CAP_SYS_NICE, which proot can never have; and the gamepad-driven cursor sprite following
  the X pointer that XTest moves (it sat frozen).
- `0110-wayland-backend-touch.patch` - DroidDeck: the nested Wayland backend bound only the host's
  pointer and keyboard, so a finger on the phone's screen never reached Steam. It now binds
  `wl_touch` too and hands each finger to wlserver's touch path (`wlserver_touchdown` / `motion` /
  `up`) - the one a Steam Deck's touchscreen drives - so what a touch does follows the client's
  touch mode (Steam's Big Picture sets Passthrough: a real touch, rows scroll under a finger).
  Finger ids are offset by one, since the nested pointer already moves wlserver's touch 0.
- `0111-wayland-pointer-warps-in-passthrough.patch` - DroidDeck: the nested pointer's motion goes to
  wlserver as touch 0, and in Passthrough (Big Picture's touch mode) a motion for a touch that is not
  down moves nothing - so in the app's touchpad mode the Steam client saw no hover and a click landed
  wherever the pointer had last been. The motion now always warps the real pointer as well
  (`bAlwaysWarpCursor`), which the other touch modes did already.

Sixteen more of Armada's patches are DRM/lease/HDR-on-KMS work for a native display, which this
app's Wayland-hosted gamescope never reaches, or need a newer gamescope than the runtime has.
